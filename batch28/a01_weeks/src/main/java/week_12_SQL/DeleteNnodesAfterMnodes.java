    1474. Delete N Nodes After M Nodes of a Linked List
    easy
    locked version : https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-n-nodes-after-m-nodes-of-a-linked-list/
    question : https://leetcode.ca/2019-12-13-1474-Delete-N-Nodes-After-M-Nodes-of-a-Linked-List/

Given the head of a linked list and two integers m and n. Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:

    Start with the head as the current node.
    Keep the first m nodes starting with the current node.
    Remove the next n nodes
    Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.

Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.

Follow up question: How can you solve this problem by modifying the list in-place?

Example 1:

Image text

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], m = 2, n = 3

Output: [1,2,6,7,11,12]

Explanation: Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the linked List (1 ->2) show in black nodes.

Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -> 4 -> 5) show in read nodes.

Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List. Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.

Example 2:

Image text

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 1, n = 3

Output: [1,5,9]

Explanation: Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 3, n = 1

Output: [1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11]

Example 4:

Input: head = [9,3,7,7,9,10,8,2], m = 1, n = 2

Output: [9,7,8]

Constraints:

    The given linked list will contain between 1 and 10^4 nodes.
    The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range [1, 10^6].
    1 <= m,n <= 1000
