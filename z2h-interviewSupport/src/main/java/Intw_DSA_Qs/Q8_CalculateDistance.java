    Calculate Distance
    Programming challenge description:
    You have (x, y) coordinates for 2 points and need to find the distance between them.
        Input:
    Your program should read lines from standard input. Each line contains two space-delimited coordinate pairs. All x and y values are integers between -100 and 100.
    Output:
    Print the distance between the two points. You do not need to round the results you receive.
    Test 1
            (25, 4) (1, -6)
    Expected Output26

    Test 2
            (47, 43) (-25, -11)
    Expected Output 90
